## Overview

Embarking on the journey of building a virtual security lab has been an enlightening experience. Inspired by the myDFIR YouTube course, this project involved creating an enterprise-like network environment using Oracle VM VirtualBox. The lab setup facilitated hands-on practice in various cybersecurity domains, including network configuration, Active Directory management, endpoint monitoring, and executing simulated attacks.

## Lab Environment Components

The virtual lab environment comprised the following systems:

- **Windows 10 Client**: Emulated a standard business workstation.
- **Kali Linux Attacker**: Served as a penetration testing platform for conducting simulated attacks.
- **Windows Server 2022**: Functioned as the Active Directory Domain Controller (AD DC), offering centralized authentication and directory services.
- **Ubuntu Server**: Acted as the Splunk log analysis server and the primary security monitoring station.

## Key Security Solutions Implemented

### **Splunk Enterprise & Universal Forwarder**

- **Purpose**: Aggregation, analysis, and visualization of logs from various systems within the network.
- **Implementation**: Installed Splunk Enterprise on the Ubuntu Server and deployed Universal Forwarders on Windows machines to collect and forward logs for centralized analysis.

### **Sysmon (System Monitor)**

- **Purpose**: Provided detailed tracking of endpoint activities on Windows systems, including process creations, network connections, and file modifications.
- **Implementation**: Installed Sysmon on Windows machines with a customized configuration to capture relevant security events, enhancing the visibility of system activities.

### **Crowbar**

- **Purpose**: Simulated brute force attacks to test the robustness of system defenses.
- **Implementation**: Utilized Crowbar on the Kali Linux machine to perform password guessing attacks against various services, aiding in assessing the strength of authentication mechanisms.

### **Atomic Red Team (ART)**

- **Purpose**: Offered a library of tests to simulate a wide range of attack techniques.
- **Implementation**: Executed ART test cases within the lab environment to evaluate the effectiveness of detection and response strategies, thereby identifying potential security gaps.

## Challenges and Learnings

Throughout the project, several challenges were encountered, leading to valuable insights:

- **System Compatibility Issues**: Ensuring seamless communication between different operating systems required meticulous network configuration and troubleshooting.
- **Resource Allocation**: Balancing system resources among multiple virtual machines was crucial to maintain optimal performance.
- **Security Tool Integration**: Integrating various security tools necessitated a deep understanding of their configurations and interoperability.

These challenges underscored the importance of a methodical approach to system setup and the need for continuous learning in the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity.

## Outcome

The successful deployment of this virtual lab environment provided a robust platform for:

- **Hands-On Practice**: Enabled practical application of theoretical knowledge in a controlled setting.
- **Skill Enhancement**: Improved proficiency in Active Directory management, security monitoring, and attack simulation.
- **Preparation for Real-World Scenarios**: Equipped with the experience to handle complex security challenges in actual enterprise environments.
