This note provides an in-depth exploration of SIM swapping and account compromise, particularly in the context of cryptocurrency hacks, with a specific emphasis on their implications for users in Ghana. It builds on key points and examples provided, offering a comprehensive overview for readers interested in understanding these threats and their local relevance.

## Background on Recent Hacks and Social Engineering

Recent hacks on crypto-affiliated X accounts have highlighted the role of social engineering in compromising security measures, including MFA and 2FA. These attacks often target the human element, exploiting trust and psychological manipulation to gain unauthorized access.

### Pump.fun X Account Hack

On February 26, 2025, the X account of [Pump.fun](https://x.com/pumpdotfun) (a Solana-based token launch platform) was compromised to promote a fake governance token called "PUMP" ([`@pumpdotfun`](https://x.com/harpieio/status/1894771002351173841)). The platform confirmed the breach and urged users not to interact with any links or messages. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT noted in a telegram post suggest that this hack is part of a pattern, linking it to similar breaches on Jupiter DAO and DogWifCoin. The attack likely involved social engineering, possibly tricking X employees with fraudulent documents or exploiting an internal panel, as speculated by ZachXBT.

### Jupiter DAO X Account Hack

In February 2025, Jupiter DAO's X account was hacked to promote a fake memecoin called `$MEOW`, leading to significant financial losses for traders ([BanklessTimes](https://www.banklesstimes.com/articles/2025/02/06/jupiters-x-account-hacked/)). The team confirmed that only the X account was compromised, with treasury holdings secure in multisig wallets. This suggests that social engineering tactics were used to bypass account security, potentially exploiting weaknesses in MFA or 2FA.

### DogWifCoin X Account Hack

In November 2024, DogWifCoin's X account was compromised to promote fake meme coins like MUU, POPWNUT, and WIFD, resulting in price manipulation and investor losses ([Crypto News](https://crypto.news/dogwifhats-x-account-hacked-to-promote-meme-coins-report/)). Web3 security firm Harpie confirmed the hack, urging users to avoid engaging with fraudulent posts. This again indicates that social engineering was a likely method behind the attack.


# Compromising MFA and 2FA: Methods and Implications

Research suggests that MFA and 2FA can be compromised through various methods, particularly in crypto hacks. Social engineering tactics—such as phishing and pretexting—are common, tricking users into revealing codes or credentials. For instance, attackers may impersonate support staff to gain trust, as noted in a [Hacken article](https://hacken.io/discover/top-7-social-engineering-frauds-in-crypto/). Additionally, SIM swapping is a significant threat, where attackers transfer a victim's phone number to intercept SMS-based 2FA codes, as detailed in a [DataVisor article](https://www.datavisor.com/wiki/sim-swapping/).

**Social Engineering Tactics:**  
Attackers use BEC attacks, impersonation, and building trust over social media to exploit human vulnerabilities, as seen in the 2019 Binance hack involving compromised 2FA-enabled accounts ([CoinTelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/multi-factor-authentication-mfa-in-cryptocurrency)).

**MFA/2FA Compromise Methods:**  
Methods include malware to intercept authentication data, exploiting software vulnerabilities, and leveraging weaknesses in recovery settings. For example, the Meduza Stealer extracts data from MFA applications and crypto wallets—making it difficult for antivirus programs to detect—as outlined in a [CSO Online article](https://www.csoonline.com/article/570795/how-to-hack-2fa.html) and reported by [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexvakulov/2024/09/05/how-hackers-bypass-mfa-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/).

# Detailed Analysis of SIM Swapping in Crypto Hacks

SIM swapping (or SIM hijacking) involves attackers tricking mobile carriers into transferring a victim's phone number, allowing them to intercept SMS-based 2FA codes. This method has victimized countless crypto investors globally, with notable cases such as a 15-year-old stealing $24 million in cryptocurrency ([UK Finance](https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/news-and-insight/blogs/how-fight-back-against-sim-swapping-blockchain-analysis)). In Ghana, evidence suggests that SIM swapping is a significant issue, underscored by specific cases and statistics.

## Real-World Example: Ghanaian Case of GH¢250,000 Loss

A striking local example is detailed in a [NewsGhana article](https://newsghana.com.gh/sim-swap-fraud-man-tells-how-he-lost-gh%C2%A2250k/), where a Ghanaian man based in London lost GH¢250,000 from his Ecobank account due to SIM swap fraud. Fraudsters swapped his MTN e-SIM, bypassing daily transaction limits—suggesting possible insider involvement at telecoms or banks. This case highlights both the direct financial impact on individuals and the sophistication of the attack.

## Scale of the Problem in Ghana: Bank of Ghana Insights

The Bank of Ghana's 2023 Fraud Report, as reported by [MyJoyOnline](https://www.myjoyonline.com/gh%C8%BC4-6-million-lost-to-sim-swap-fraud-in-2023-bog-reports/) and [Adomonline.com](https://www.adomonline.com/gh%C8%BC4-6-million-lost-to-sim-swap-fraud-in-2023-bog-reports/), revealed that GH¢4.6 million was lost to SIM swap fraud across 15 recorded cases in 2023. This rapid emergence of the scam targets individuals with mobile banking access, including banking apps and WhatsApp banking. The report notes that scammers often have inside help from telecom agents, enabling them to intercept calls, texts, and control banking apps—bypassing security measures.

## EOCO's Response and Ongoing Challenges

Ghanaian authorities are not sitting idle. The Economic and Organized Crime Office (EOCO) has taken action against SIM swap fraud. In a 2022 operation detailed by [allAfrica.com](https://allafrica.com/stories/202204070655.html), EOCO recovered over GH¢200,000 and arrested four suspects. This operation, conducted in collaboration with the Ghana Association of Banks, targeted fraudsters who illegally accessed customer accounts using SIM swaps. However, the persistence of cases—as seen in the Bank of Ghana report—indicates that challenges remain, with potential insider involvement at telecoms and banks complicating efforts.

# How SIM Swapping Works in Ghana

Given Ghana's high mobile penetration—with over 40 million subscriptions in 2023 ([NCA](https://www.geopoll.com/blog/mobile-penetration-and-internet-usage-in-ghana/))—and the popularity of mobile money services like MTN MoMo, SIM swapping poses a substantial risk. The process typically involves:

- **Information Gathering:**  
  Attackers collect personal details through phishing, social media, or data breaches, exploiting the fact that 47% of Ghanaians are active on social media ([DataReportal 2024](https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2024-ghana)).

- **Social Engineering the Carrier:**  
  They contact carriers (e.g., MTN, Vodafone, or AirtelTigo), posing as the victim, claiming a lost SIM, and using stolen information to authenticate.

- **SIM Transfer:**  
  The carrier reassigns the number, allowing the attacker to intercept SMS messages—including 2FA codes for crypto accounts.

- **Accessing Accounts:**  
  With control of the number, attackers can drain wallets or take over exchange accounts, as illustrated by the GH¢250,000 loss case.

# Comparative Analysis: Global and Local Trends

Globally, SIM swap fraud has been a concern in regions such as the UAE and U.S., with the FBI reporting over $68 million in losses in 2021 ([CoinTelegraph](https://example.com/cointelegraph)). In Africa, a 2019 [Africa Briefing](https://example.com/africabriefing) article noted a doubling of cases in South Africa, reflecting a regional trend. In Ghana, the combination of the mobile money boom and rapid crypto adoption amplifies the risk, with attackers targeting both traditional banking and digital assets.

# Account Compromise: Exploiting Trust in the Digital Age

Account compromise adds another layer of risk, particularly in the crypto space. The Pump.fun hack illustrates how attackers leverage trusted accounts to scam followers by posting fraudulent requests for crypto transfers. In Ghana, this is especially relevant given high social media engagement. For example, a 2022 case reported by [GhanaWeb](https://example.com/ghanaweb) detailed how a hacked influencer's account was used to scam followers out of GH¢10,000 via mobile money—demonstrating how trust can be weaponized.

# Mitigation Strategies: Practical Tips for Ghanaian Users

To combat these threats, users can take several precautionary measures:

- **Ditch SMS 2FA:**  
  Opt for app-based methods (e.g., [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447)) or hardware-based methods (e.g., [Yubikey](https://www.yubico.com)). These methods are not vulnerable to SIM swapping and are supported by most crypto platforms, including Binance.

- **Lock Your SIM:**  
  Contact your carrier (e.g., MTN at 100 or Vodafone at 100) to set a PIN for SIM changes and request a "port freeze" to prevent unauthorized transfers.

- **Monitor Activity:**  
  A sudden loss of cell service can be a red flag—if you experience this, call your carrier immediately to check for a SIM swap.

- **Privacy Hygiene:**  
  Limit the public exposure of personal information on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) or WhatsApp to reduce the data attackers can use.

- **Verify Before Sending:**  
  If an X account you follow posts a crypto address or promotion, verify its authenticity through direct messages or other channels before sending money—especially after high-profile hacks like Pump.fun.
